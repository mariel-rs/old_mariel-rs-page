## Welcome

Hola, my name is Mariel Reyes-Salazar (_/maˈɾjɛl/_ or combine Mary + Daniel together, that's me). I am an engineer with an innate taste for programming languages, technology and applied mathematics. Proud [UNAM](http://www.unam.mx/) alumna and Operational Research graduate from the University of Edinburgh.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked for 7 years in a software company taking roles in consultancy and software development for a model predictive control solution used in the oil and petrochemical industries. 

My interest is to use data, technology and applied optimization to understand the world and make complex decisions faster. I am particularly keen in making STEM more accessible for everybody. I am certain sciences are for everyone and not only for _smart people_.

I used to publish my code under the `chiclez` username, which was my username for years during university and graduate studies. Below you will find the projects I have been working during my MSc and in my spare time. 

### Projects

1. Heuristic methods for the airport slot allocation problem: MSc. dissertation project, under the supervision of [Dr Miguel Anjos](https://miguelanjos.com/). Collaborated with Paula Fermín-Cueto and [Dr Sergio García-Quiles](https://sites.google.com/site/sergiogarciaquiles/).
2. [Managing solid waste in Central Portugal](https://github.com/mariel-rs/MSW_Portugal): Mini-case study for allocating obnoxious facilities in Central Portugal using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The implementation was done using Pyomo, FICO Xpress and Geopandas for GIS visualization.
3. [Predicting cuisines of recipes](https://github.com/mariel-rs/022-DME-project): Predicted the cuisine type of a recipe by training different classification models using a large dimensional dataset (4236 recipes and 709 different ingredients). Explored several dimensional reduction methods and collaborative filtering using similarity functions.
4. [Bike rebalancing for Just Eat Edinburgh](https://github.com/mariel-rs/map/): Designed a schedule for rebalancing bike stations for Just Eat bikesharing using FICO Xpress and Python for data processing.
5. Biomarkers and pain: Statistical study where different biomarkers were investigated as possible causes for a medical condition. Implemented a regression model, aided with random forests for feature selection using R.
6. Predicting IMDb rating for The Office: Exploratory analysis of historical data for The Office (US) TV show using Python. Designed a regression model using Ridge regularization.
7. Predicting hotel cancellations: Explored different classification models and implemented a random forest model obtaining a prediction accuracy of 82%
8. Laptop manufacturing simulation: Designed a simulation for a typical laptop manufacting line using Simul8 and Python for the input and output analysis. Using the simulation results, proposed several improvements that would debottleneck the manufacturing line and increase throughput.
